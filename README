Numbers::Ordinal
A way to transform numbers into ordinal form
-----

===Summary
Numbers::Ordinal is designed to provide a way of writing ordinal numbers (e.g. first, second) when the situation requires it.

(This module does not deal with the more abstract notion in set theory, you mathematician!)

===Installation
If you aren't using neutro, then simply go into this module's directory (probably where you found this README) and type

    $ ufo
    $ make install

You will need Carl Mäsak's program    ufo    to do this. See <https://github.com/masak/ufo>.
